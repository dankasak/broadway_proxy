This file contains known issues and ideas to be worked on

- port configuration
  some port numbers are hardcoded
  marked with comment >>>> # TODO: port config from sqlite

  default ports are initialized via db setup, see ./schema_upgrades
  they can be modified via Datasheet in config.pl

- session management
  cookies are created without lifetime, as session-cookies

  some browsers do not clear session cookies on exit
  https://makandracards.com/makandra/28275-psa-chrome-and-firefox-do-not-always-clear-session-cookies-on-exit

  this might become a problem when session-cookie is properly 
  cleared by browser. Existing broadway sessions will never get 
  closed and can no longer be accessed.

- session management
  connecting to the proxy service creates a new auth cookie 
  when cookie doesn't exist or existing cookie is not found in db

  after user authentication via login form, a new auth cookie is 
  created in auth_service.pl. It is written to the db (Checkpoint 4)
  and sent to the browser (Checkpoint 5,6)

  described behaviour above is overwriting any existing session info
  running with same user in a different browser.
