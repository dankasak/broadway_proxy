issues


ideas

- logging
  separate debug from production logging

- config.pl and perl Forms
  using perl forms requires Gtk3 with compiled in broadway support
  CentOS7.7 lacks broadway support

- startup
  systemd service definition

- more flexible auth service
  we'd like to manage users and app permissions remote (AD, LDAP, ERP)
