This file contains known issues and ideas to be worked on

issues

- port configuration
  some port numbers are hardcoded
  marked with comment >>>> # TODO: port config from sqlite

  default ports are initialized via db setup, see ./schema_upgrades
  they can be modified via Datasheet in config.pl

ideas

- logging
  separate debug from production logging

- config.pl and perl Forms
  using perl forms requires Gtk3 with compiled in broadway support
  CentOS7.7 lacks broadway support

- startup
  systemd service definition

- more flexible auth service
  we'd like to manage users and app permissions remote (AD, LDAP, ERP)
