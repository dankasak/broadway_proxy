This directory contains a sample script
for running Gtk application in a bwrap sandbox,
setting up a virtual user environment with restricted
access to a small set of predefined directories.

In order for this to work, the connection between broadwayd
and the Gtk application must be must be switched to use tcp sockets 
instead of the default unix domain sockets. With Gtk3, this can be done
by using a BROADWAY_DISPLAY setting of the form :tcp<N>, whereas <N>
is the display number. It will result in using tcp port 9090 + <N>
for communication between the Gtk app and broadwayd. 

We couldn't figure out yet, 
how to make unix domain sockets work with bwrap.

@see sessionmanager.patch for details
