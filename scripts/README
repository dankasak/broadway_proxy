This directory contains a sample script
for running Gtk application in a bwrap sandbox,
setting up a virtual user environment with restricted
access to a small set of predefined directories.

In order for this to work, the connection between broadwayd
and the Gtk application must be must be switched to use tcp sockets 
instead of the default unix domain sockets. With Gtk3, this can be done
by using a BROADWAY_DISPLAY setting of the form :tcp<N>, whereas <N>
is the display number. It will result in using tcp port 9090 + <N>
for communication between the Gtk app and broadwayd.

Explanation

Broadwayd uses **abstract** unix domain sockets for communication 
between broadwayd and Gtk application. The name of the abstract
socket is created with the aid of g_get_user_runtime_dir(). 
This way, it will create different socket names for broadwayd (runing 
under an ordinary user account) and the Gtk application (running under 
a virtual bwrap user).

For abstract unix domain sockets to work with different user contexts,
Gdk broadway must be patched to use a fixed abstract socket name, not
depending on the user.
